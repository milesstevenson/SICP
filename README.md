My stab at the SICP exercises. It seems Racket and mit-scheme are necessary in this book.
### Requirements ###
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org/)
[MIT-Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme//)

### Testing ###
From chapter 2 onwards, I've decided to make an attempt to test my solutions with some sort of structure. I'm attempting to use [test-manager](http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/testing-1.2.html), an automated unit-testing framework for MIT-Scheme.
